# Dig into the Blood

In the zip file in the C&C server, R-boy’s found a folder. It contains an image showing the industrial site’s main building, one other file, and nothing else. It can't be another dead end! Help R-boy see if there’s anything hidden in the image.

The image is in the folder and shown here:

![Dig Into The Blood](Dig+into+the+Blood.png "Dig Into The Blood")

## Resolve

Use GIMP to alter the image colors and then the **FLAG** will appear:
{FLG:TargetBuilding.dxf}
